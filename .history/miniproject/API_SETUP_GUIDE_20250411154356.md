# Setting Up Plant.id API Key

## Step 1: Sign Up for a Plant.id Account

1. Go to [Plant.id API Access Key page](https://web.plant.id/api-access-key/)
2. Click on "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Complete the registration process with your email and password

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. After signing up, you'll be redirected to your dashboard
2. Look for a section labeled "API Key" or "Access Key"
3. Copy your API key (it will look something like `abc123def456ghi789`)

## Step 3: Update Your .env File

1. Open the `.env` file in the root of your project
2. Find the line that says `VITE_PLANT_ID_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`
3. Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_PLANT_ID_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789
   ```
4. Save the file

## Step 4: Restart Your Development Server

1. Stop your current development server (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Start it again with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the "API key is not configured" error:

1. Make sure you've saved the `.env` file after making changes
2. Verify that the API key is correctly copied without any extra spaces
3. Check that the environment variable name is exactly `VITE_PLANT_ID_API_KEY`
4. Ensure you've restarted the development server after making changes
